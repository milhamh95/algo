# 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Example 1

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

Output: 6

Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

## Example 2

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]

Output: 9
